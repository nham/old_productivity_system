I have not really used the log. That needs to be fixed.

I have not been using TODO.

I fell out of practice of time tracking for the first 3.5 hours today (and argubably overslept).


Another thing is I have not looked in Troutman at all. You keep forgetting that you have to become *amazing*. 


I also have not been able to construct rough plans for going through the material. I should actually do that now.

One idea for a project is a video tutorial on what derivatives are, conceptually. It would probably include a number of things like the chain rule (understanding exactly what it says).


Need to return to strictly delineating projects. For break purposes at least.


 - Project 1: go through Moving Stars Around (also, Rust implementation)
 - Project 2: read Troutman's Variational Calculus book
 - Project 3: read Hirsch and Smale
 - Project 4: read Naive Lie Theory
 - Project 5: a video series of some kind. Perhaps calculus

ahh, so projects are each dedicated to at least one goal. "working on the project" consitutes making progress towards associated goals.

Break time **cannot be used to work on any of the above**. At least end the break and start a new block.

Should "get the TODO system in working order" be a Project? I need dedicated time to work on it.

Let's try scheduling a block dedicated to familiarizing with TODO system,

After refreshing myself on how taskwarrior organizes things (the primary thing being each task item can belong to a project), I see how to organize studies.

I have 5 active projects at the moment:

 - HirschSmale
 - MovingStars
 - NaiveLie
 - Troutman_VC
 - calc_vid_series

Things that I need to do to make progress on these projects must go in the TODO under this project name. Study is coordinated through the TODO list.

We can do filtering by the project, and so when we begin a block on Naive Lie theory, we can type "task proj:NaiveLie next" to see what needs to be done next.

There are certain recurring tasks, and it would be nice if we didn't have to manually add them with "wait:18th" or whatever. I still need to research if it's possible.

A major idea I have is building a scheduler that randomly gives me what topics I should study on a given day (say 3 of the 5 topics per day). Or really I should probably do like:

Today:: Troutman_VC / NaiveLie / calc_vid_series 
Tomorrow: HirschSmale / Moving Stars / Troutman_VC
Next:: NaiveLie / calc_vid_series / HirschSmale

so it cycles through the 5, 3 per day, just in that order. I would like to automatically create tasks for a certain number of blocks per day, which I then have to actually do. Also meditation sessions as well? Or is this going wayyy overboard?

"potential_projs" project is used to accumulate ideas for future projects

There is also a way to do subtasks:

    task 1 modify depends:2-4

You can add due dates for task with 

    task 17 modify due:19th


"task timesheet" gives you what you've done in the week so far.

There's also something to do with "burndown.daily" where you can see a graph of the tasks you create/complete each day.

The question is how fast can I go in studying. Is 10 pages per hour too excessive? 5 pages an hour? If 193 pages is what I aim to read in Troutman, 5 pages an hour is ~40 hours. I then need to put an average of 40/7 hours per day studying Troutman, or 5.17 hours a day. The pace is not quick enough? But it would be much quicker than the way I've been going though.

If I aim to work 60 hours a week, thats 12 hours per project per week at equal allocation, so for reading projects at 5 pages an hour we have 5*12 = 60 pages per week. This might be a good place to start since at 3 book projects thats 180 pages per week I'm pledging to understand, plus the reading in moving stars.


In a normal full week, 60 hours a week is 7*9 - 3, so its (9 - 3/7) hours per day to get 63 - 3 = 60 hours a week. We could just make it 9? 6


Let's plot 8 hours a day, 7 hours a week. That's 56 hours a week. In an 8 hour block we can do 2 hr 40 min = 160 min on each subject.

abc dea bcd eab cde | abc dea


what if we do


(70*2 + 100)*2 + 65*2 + 95


55 min topic a
15 min break

55 min topic b
15 min break

55 min topic c
45 min break

55 min topic a
15 min break

55 min topic b
15 min break

55 min topic c
45 min break

50 min topic a
15 min break

50 min topic b
15 min break

50 min topic c
60 min break

The above is 12 hours, but theres exactly 8 hours of project work in this.

Anything beyond this is unstructured time for now.


We also have to do something about the rest of tonight since it's not a full day.

It's now 2015 Jan 15 19:05:34, so if we do two 55/15/55/15/55/45 cycles, cycle takes 240 = 4 hours, so two of them will take 8 hours and will bring us to (assuming we start at 19:30)$ to 3:30. That will be okay for today.


Actually let's do two 50/15/50/15/50/45. Each cycle takes 130 + 50 + 45 = 225 minutes, or 3 hr 45 minutes, so two of them take 7.5 hours.
