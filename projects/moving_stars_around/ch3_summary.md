The first step in solving the n-body problem is to solve the 2-body problem. One way of solving it is by using relative coordinates. "we can transform the two-body problem into a one-body problem"


Consider the problem where we have one massive stationary body and another much smaller body moving w.r.t. the first body, then the problem is easy to solve: we assume the massive body never moves, and then we just solve newton's equation for one body.


A new origin changes the actual geometric vector. A rotation or reflection doesnt actually change what arrow it is, geometrically, just its coordinate representation.


We also will be sticking with inertial frames of reference for now.


First step is to calculate c.o.m. of the two particles. So we have a single coordinate system and the trajectories $r_1$ and $r_2$, each w.r.t. the coordinate system. We can compute c.o.m. Note that

$$r := r_2 - r_1$$

is the same no matter what the origin of the coordinate system is.
